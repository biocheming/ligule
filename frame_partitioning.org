If I am given a number of trajectories for the same system with
different numbers of frames in each e.g.:

#+NAME: but
| trajectory | frames |
|------------+--------|
|          0 | 3650   |
|          1 | 3674   |
|          2 | 3679   |
|          3 | 3678   |
|          4 | 3688   |
|          5 | 3672   |
|          6 | 3670   |
|          7 | 3680   | 

#+NAME: dmso
| trajectory | frames |
|------------+--------|
|          0 |   6007 |
|          1 |   6007 |
|          2 |   6009 |
|          3 |   6007 |
|          4 |   6005 |
|          5 |   6007 |
|          6 |   6007 |
|          7 |   6007 |

#+NAME: dss
| trajectory | frames |
|------------+--------|
|          0 |   8884 |
|          1 |   9086 |
|          2 |   8839 |
|          3 |   9106 |
|          4 |   2890 |
|          5 |   9028 |
|          6 |   8994 |
|          7 |   9028 |

As in "dss" trajectory 4 we see that it has significantly less frames
due to an unresponsive GPU during computation. The work that should
have been done on that one was given to other GPUs to compute and was
added to the other trajectories.

1) We have to decide first what the number of frames to take between
each system is.

2) How to get back the redistributed simulation frames lost from any
   trajectory by taking evenly from other trajectories in the same
   system.

If we simply take the smallest number of frames for a system we might
get an abandoned one. So we should look to the median for guidance.
